am developing the same old alpha beta search tree pruning chess playing program that everyone else in the world has  i plan to  at some point  set it up to run on a beowulf cluster or some other sort

neural network  one that i have trained with the large amount of expert data  large amount  i have collected  evaluation will be the process of assigning a  score  to a position  with a maximum score of k  where a score of  k is the best possible score in favor of white  and  k is the best possible score in favor of black     expert data    a bit more information about my expert data  chess games are often stored in a notation called pgn  the most important details given in this expert data is a  who won the game  which i think i can use to decide whose moves to categorize positively and whose moves to categorize negatively   and b  every move made  which i already have a system capable of parsing these moves      i know that the basis of training a neural network  and really the basis of any machine learning training phase  is attempting to achieve results as close to a target function as possible  in this case  i don t have a  known  target function  i just want to be as  correct  as possible  in cases like this  where the target function isn t known up front  but can really only be assessed later  as in  this player won  so his moves should possibly be scored higher   how is the best way to achieve this goal      for a chessboard representation  there are many pieces of information that can be gathered  what piece is on a square  how many of one piece are on a board  where is a particular piece located  sort of the reverse of  what piece is on a square    what is the  positional value   some pieces are more suited at particular locations on the board  or  material value   some pieces are worth more than others  of a board  things of this nature  what should the input to a neural network given the abundance of data available regarding each position  is it feasible to expect the input nodes to be    nodes representing each position on the board  and this be enough for the network to be able to learn the subtle nuances between pieces and positions and strength   in regards to      i m not asking what my input set should be  i don t want you guys to do my work for me  i just don t know whether or not only providing the    squares of the board as input data is a realistic input set to expect the results i m wanting      is it problematic    or really  does it even matter    that the input set is likely to be discrete  while i m wanting continuous output  i don t think i quite grasp whether or not this is an issue with neural networks      is it possible to give a neural network  negative  training data  i m not sure if it would help or hurt  but with this wealth of expert data i have  i could potentially use the loser as negative training data  if i can t  i honestly have more than enough  positive  data that this shouldn t be a problem ', 'uci

are the labels i know about and the question marks are there because i don t exactly know what the labels there should be  the second row is just used to refer to timepoints in this example  the question marks really show transitions from one label into another  but i don t know exactly where the transition is  this means that a question mark should be one of the two surrounding labels  and not anything else  and that if we have aa    bb and the second question mark is a b  then the next ones should also be b s  my first problem is basically how to incorporate the information i do have about these samples in my algorithm   the second problem has to do with the fact that not all labels are equally important  if for every group of non zero s just one would be classified correctly and the rest would be classified as zero  that would be great  so in the above example i would be happier if all samples would be classified as zeros except  m    b  and  o  than if for instance  j o  would be classified correctly and the rest would be zeros  even though the latter would technically give a higher accuracy  my second problem is thus how to deal with this unequal preference for different labels   i guess i could just ignore all of this information i have  but the problem is that when i do that  performance is very bad  of course  there is no guarantee that using it will make things much better  but i m hoping it will   i m still quite new to this field  so if anyone could point me in the direction of algorithms that can be used for this  suggest resources that apply to this or even  like books  webpages or other places to ask questions like this  a stackoverflow for science questions would be great  come up with solutions for my problems  that would be great  i ve

that i needed to over smooth the distribution quite a bit to get good results   it looks like having a bit of variance is just fine if i m trying to minimize the error between my estimate and the

hidden markov models    hi folks   i ve built a hmm for my work and am now looking at the output the model is giving me  the problem is that my b w calibrated hmm doesn t seem to have great discriminating power  what i expect to see is the calibrated observation distribution in each state to be peaked at different symbols  so that i can identify symbols by states  if i use a short observation sequence for the calibration  i do see this behaviour  when i use a long sequence  however  i get very similar distributions in each state   for reference  my model has   hidden states  there are    possible observation symbols  when i say  short sequence   i mean about       symbols  when i say  long sequence   i mean more like           is there a heuristic for setting up the

that are either the same or different in every variable  ie  cards which all have green hashed diamond  in quantities      and   would be a set  because in the color  shape and fill they would be all the same and in number they would be all different    the game play progresses as follows     cards are turned face up on the table  everyone looks for a set  and when someone finds they say  set  and remove those cards  new cards are turned up to replace them  if no set can be found   cards are added to the face up cards though when the first subsequent set is removed no cards are placed to replace them so that the number is usually     and returns to that if it grows      now the question  for a given number of cards turned up on the table  what is the probability that a set exists in those cards     this is my answer so far  though it doesn t produce numbers that make sense to me  i think all the probabilities are too high   for a number of cards n the probability is    ncr n         ncr          ncr          ncr           the thinking being that all possible sets in the deck are given by ncr       since all combinations of   cards can make a set  they  point  to their third card   but their are three pairings of   cards per set  so we have to divide by three  the total number of potential sets is ncr       so the probability that any three cards are a set is the ratio of the total number of sets over the total number of ways to combine   cards  so to tie that to n cards we just find the number of ways to pick   cards from a given number  i must be making some mistake

of surveys go out and i want to check and refine my methodology with the experts before i go through it again  specifically  i have a couple questions for which i haven t found an answer      most of the survey questions warrant a finite population correction for the standard error of the mean  but i have the problem of not always knowing with certainty which underlying population should represent the total population n  here s why    all respondents answer the question  are you a or b   before answering a series of likert scale questions  which are different depending on whether the respondent selected a or b  suppose i m looking at the subset of respondents who answered  a   for the finite population correction for the standard error of the mean for the  a  likert data  is it kosher to use the proportion of the known total population  from which all respondents are drawn  who answered a in the sample as n    to illustrate  say i have a sample of     respondents from a finite population of          of the respondents answer a  and so answer a bunch of questions based on a  for these questions that only respondents who selected  a  answer  can i use     as the underlying n in the finite population correction  the problem is that the proportion who answered a is only a sample and so the true value is unknown   i thought a conservative approach would be to use the proportion of the population that is the upper     ci for those that answered  a   but i settled on using the exact proportion from the sample      regarding measuring the error of the likert data  what should i do
